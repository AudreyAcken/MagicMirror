# Introduction

This project creates an IoT "Magic Mirror" device. When the mirror is turned off, it looks like an ordinary mirror. However, when turned on, it can display the date, time, weather, and take/save a picture. Read more about this project here: http://www.annecyscorner.com/MagicMirrorWebsite/magicmirror.
